                Jordan Terrell Carter, popularly known by his stage name Playboi Carti, is an American hip hop singer,
                rapper, and model. Growing up in a financially disadvantaged family, Carti had to struggle a lot during
                his early years. His early life struggles are reflected in his music and lifestyle even today.

                Carti started his career with the stage name of Sir Cartier. In 2012, he decided to change his musical
                style and deleted almost all his previous content from the internet. He also adopted the new stage name
                of Playboi Carti. He joined the underground Atlanta label ‘Awful Records’ and later switched to ASAP
                Rocky's ‘AWGE’. Currently under contract with the major record label ‘Interscope’, an imprint of
                Interscope Geffen A&M Records, Carti released his mixtape ‘Playboi Carti’ in 2017 which peaked at the
                12th position on the US Billboard 200.

                Carter's fashion style is one of the main features of his public image. GQ has defined Carter as the
                "leader of a youth style," and said that he represents a stylistic midpoint between the "fashion gloss
                of A$AP Mob, the punk-rock attitude of Uzi Vert, and the playful camp of Yachty."
                Carter's favorite brands include Raf Simons and Balmain. Carter met Simons at a fashion show in New
                York. Carter is featured on the song "RAF" by A$AP Mob, which was dedicated to the Raf Simons brand.
                The music video for the song included Carter, A$AP Rocky, and Quavo wearing rare Raf Simons clothing.
                Carter considers Kanye West and A$AP Rocky inspirations for his fashion style.
                Carter has modeled numerous times, including for Kanye West's Yeezy Season 5, VFiles,
                and Drake's OVO Lookbook, alongside Ian Connor and John Ross.
